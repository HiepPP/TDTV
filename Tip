///JSONP
JSONP works by issuing a GET request using a <script> tag, instead of using XHR requests. The
JSONP technique creates a <script> tag and places it in the DOM. When it shows up in the DOM,
the browser takes over and requests the script referenced in the src tag.

///$apply
The $apply() function executes an expression inside of the Angular context from outside of the
Angular framework. For instance, if we implement a setTimeout() or are using a third-party library
and we want the event to run inside the Angular context, we must use $apply().
